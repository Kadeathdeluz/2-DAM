#Variables definition x is an int and y is a String
x = 1
y = "this is a String"

print("Variables: ")
print("x = ", x, "y = ", y)


#In Python you can assing a value to a variable
# and then change its type like this:

x = 42 # x here is an int
print(x)
x = "some text" #x here is a String
print(x)

#You can also specify the data type of a variable with casting:

#x will be an int
x = int(3)
print(x)

#x will be a String
x = str("other text")
print(x)

#x will be a boolean
x = bool(True)
print(x)
